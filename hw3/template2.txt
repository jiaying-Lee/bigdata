2-e) How many clusters are there?

8995



2-f) How many clusters are there?

When n=2, there are 8888 clusters


2-g) Which fingerprint strategy works better for plate_id? How about for street_name? Explain.

Fingerprint works better for plate_id. Since plated_id only has 3 letters and 4 numbers and no whitespace between letters.
So they can be regarded as one word. And dealing with one word, fingerprint would do nothing when the word
has different order of the same letters, but the n-gram would conduct the same output. However, because of this
feature of n-gram, n-gram would cluster items that they are supposed to be different.

eg. Fingerprint:    key:jnp981     values:JNP981&,JNP981
                    key:l21687     values:L.21687,L21687

n-gram fingerprint: key:088088e8fegf     values:GFE8808,GFE8088

In this case, GFE8808 and GFE8088 are different plated id, but similar. They should not be clustered.


Fingerprint works better for street_name when choosing a proper value for n. As the reason above, n-gram would reduce
the case that has repeat letters in one word but fingerprint would not. Thus, n-gram would make mistakes, especially
when n is too small. when n=1, many different information might be computed as the same and there are 6867 clusters since many different street_name are put into the same cluster.

eg.
Fingerprint:
    key:blvd springfield    values:SPRINGFIELD BLVD,SPRINGFIELD  BLVD,;SPRINGFIELD BLVD,Springfield Blvd
    key:10044 main nyny st  values:MAIN ST NYNY 10044

n-gram fingerprintï¼š
when n=2,
    key:222ndse2ndst  values:E 222ND ST, E 22ND ST, E 222nd St,E 22nd St
when n=1, n-gram fingerprint:
key:01aehtv     values:10TH AVE, 110th Ave, 100th Ave, 10th Ave

When n is too big, too many items are put into the cluster with null key.
eg. when n=4,
    key:''   values:'E 51', '', '9 ST', 'CPW', 'W 53', 'E 96', 'E 94', '6 ST', '8 ST', '5 ST', 'E 80', 'AV', 'E 2', 'CIA', 'E 34', 'E 37', 'E 52', 'E 49', '1 10', 'E 70', '252', 'W 12', 'WEA', 'W 83', 'W 75', 'GCP', '2ND', '45', 'WPR', 'LEE', '158', '217', 'E 44', 'E 48', '98', '112', '1', 'RSD', '1 ST', '1ST', 'E 86', 'E 84', '174', 'O P', 'ACP', '9ST', 'E 77', 'E 89', '70', 'W 73', 'W 78', 'W 68', 'W 96', '4 ST', '7 ST', 'A/C', 'C/O', '2 ST', '5TH', 'E 87', 'E 23', 'E 21', 'E 46', 'E 24', 'E 69', 'RBB', 'E 31', 'E 32', 'E 35', 'E 55', 'E 72', 'AVE', 'E 36', '195', 'W 10', 'W 77', 'R/S', 'E 54', '105', '99', 'E 60', 'E 79', 'E 12', '3RD', 'E 7', 'BBA', 'E', 'E 4', '76', '62', 'LEX', 'AV M', 'E 38', 'BPE', '8  ST'


2-h) Clearly explain the transformations that you have chosen for street_name column. How many 
     clusters do you have after applying these transformations? 

The transformations are applied during the clustering. Here I choose fingerprint to do clustering.

After changing all characters to their lowercase representation, I have done following transformations :

(1) change all the street special noun to the abbreviation. eg. change street to st
(2) change all cardinal direction to abbreviation. eg. change west to w
(3) change the ordinal number to cardinal number. eg. change 100th to 100

Then do the rest part of the n-gram fingerprint.

There are 6938 clusters after applying these transformations.



2-i) Examine the clusters in 2.h and propose how to repair the data. Explain your recommendation.

With the transformations, the number of clusters is significantly decreased.

With the combination of fingerprint. This method has these advantages:

(1)remove the influence of street abbreviation
eg. key:100 st  values:-100 STREET,100 ST,100 STREET,100TH ST,100th St
(RD STREET to ST)

(2)remove the influence of direction abbreviation
eg. key:10 st w  values:W 10 ST,WEST 10TH ST,W 10th St
(west equals to w)

(3)remove the influence of ordinal number
eg. key:10 st w  values:W 10 ST,WEST 10TH ST,W 10th St
(10TH equals to 10)

(4)remove the influence of lowercase and uppercase
eg. key:116 bch st    values:BEACH 116 STREET,Beach 116th St
(Beach equals to BEACH)

(5)remove the influence of punctuation and control characters
eg. key:johns pl st    values:ST . JOHNS PL,St Johns Pl,ST JOHNS PL,ST .JOHNS PL
(ST . JOHNS PL equals to ST JOHNS PL)
